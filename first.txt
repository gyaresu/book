No network, no joy. Great holiday. Sigh.

Zach was just grinding out the sarcasm from within the safe harbour of his mind. 

On a boat. Headed to Naxos. Sigh. 

This holiday was supposed to be a perk. So far it had been disconnection, loss and longing fed into the machinations of contemporary international transport.

Meat grinder package holiday of doom. Except that it wasn't. Not really. A couple of flights and a few airports with some train action in between had led to Pireus and then from that port back to a hotel while waiting an extra day due to the ferry crew strike.

Sigh.

No pressure. No, really. Zach was supposed to be pressure-less. Doctors orders. Which is an unfortunate expression these days. As if doctors were in any position to give orders any more. Doctors. Another victim of the great knowledge flattening. The distribution and access of the entity now known as the interwebs leaves no edifice uncrumbled.
Pill pushers... now ain't that the truth. Zack's doctor had relieved his pills of duty though. No more oxy, no more adhd glories. Even the percs he'd take with morning espresso had been left behind. For all of Zack's self indulgent egomaniacal mental posturing even he had to admit that there are still some in the world who know a whole lot more than can be presented in any online format. Begrudgingly he respected and trusted Dr. Barnes.
Doc Barnes had been the first glimmer in the darkness after a litany of disinterested prescription monkeys. Th first to verbalise how completly full of himself Zack really was. That was pretty much the first test for Zack. Relinquishing the power of self diagnosis is hard. He respected the doc. Not that he liked what the doc had to say. In fact the doc was downright blunt when it came to his assessment of the viability of Zach's mortal vessel. Zach's mortal vessel was not long for this
world. This was not entirely unexpected news to Zach.

The first meet with the doc had been about three months ago. In that time he'd gone through some detox and some downtime. Just not enough. Hence the islands. The idea although his own was triggered by an end of contract and the payment that should follow. Except that it didn't.

Assholes. Zack somewhat understood his clients misconceptions when faced with their abrogation of responsibility though. It must be hard for them, not believing in his ability to enforce consequences. It just wasn't fun any more. Now it hadn't always been easy to collect on terms but it had been more than a decade since his contracts were small enough to let slide. These days he only worked a couple of contracts per year. And these days, everybody paid. Except, they didn't. Sigh.

With the ferry still underway and another couple of hours to kill Zack needed to get out of his head. His head was the last place he needed to be and with no direct access to the net he decided to find mischief within his vicinity. So out comes the deck. Thin and black. No stickers, no bling, no brand, no head-turning conspicuousness of any kind. It wasn't ugly and it wasn't huge. It wasn't mono-pieces brushed aluminium either. It was just a deck. Only it
wasn't.

Zach could barely respond if ever asked 'what kind of laptop is that?'. This was no laptop. A huge fan of a certain table top roleplaying game while growing up, Zach could only ever concieve of the world going one direction. In that world he was going to be a decker and every decker needed a cyberdeck. Zach's 'laptop' was actually a fairly common set of components thanks to the wonders of mass production yet it is doubtfull these parts had every been assembled in quite the same way. The
case was moulded from carbon nanotubes (black
dust ordered online basically) blended
with a high-strength flexible polymer from a JPL recipe (Who doesn't love NASA's robot geeks?). Ridiculously strong yet flexible and incredibly light. Almost pointless really because of the relatively soft electrical
innards but it gave him such joy. Unlike the gaffer tape. Always with the gaffer tape. He'd relinquished hope of casting functional covers for the sides of his deck. He just never found a way to cleverly integrate them so they wouldn't just get in the damn way when any of the ports were being used. Which is understandable once you've taken note of how many little metalic holes are to be found around the edge of the deck. Maybe the next itteration, maybe a flash of brilliance will come with
the faintest of insight into a more classy form of camoflage. Until then. The gaff abides.

11 ports. Outlets. Sockets. Traps. 11 ports is what the gaff covers. Lots and lots of little sticky ports. They are the external clue to the uniqueness of this otherwise mundane seeming device. Mundane computers have a 'brain'. It's the Central Processing Unit that 'runs' programmes. One CPU by itself does time-sharing. Each programme getting some necessary calculation done and then told once more to wait its turn. Barely does this time-sharing
become apparent to humans because it's happening millions of times per second and even though in series, one after the other. So even the benefits of a Quad Core CPU are wasted on any but the most advanced users or the laziest programmes. But one of the problems with CPU's is being a victim of its own success. All that raw single threaded processing power generates a lot of heat and is by and large an impressive yet unnecessary feature in a world of content consumers. Which is why this deck has 4 Graphical Processing Units and two quad core CPU's.
GPU's were designed for parallelism. Handy when you want to generate the millions of polygons required thirty times every second while fragging monsters in _generic_shootemup_. GPU's and their thousands of cores are more suited to running the kinds of small but simultaneous calculations that would otherwise have taxed the CPU for an exponentially longer time. GPU's don't have to be power houses. GPU's just need to do simple things like compare two strings of characters. It's
just that they need to do as many of them as possible per second and right now they need to do them to "Dave's phone".

Dave and his phone are understandably rather than blissfully unaware of any of the subsequent ramifications around Dave's phone broadcasting itself via the built-in Bluetooth wireless tranciever.
Dave's phone should be more careful. But they never are. Silly phone.
Bluetooth is a really handy way of connecting two devices wirelessly without needing a router or any other infrastructure. Or at least it should be. What it ends up being is a necessary frustration when you want to use a handsfree headset with your phone. Pairing is tedious. 

Pairing is a really good way of stopping random strangers using your phone or gadgets. What it's not good at is arguing. Two of the bluetooth radio devices built into Zach's deck were arguing with Dave's phone right now. And they were winning the argument. Mainly through subverting the argument before it could even take place. As with all technology the relatively simple act of getting a headset and a phone to trust each other was actually built on literaly dozens of different programmes
and protocols working together.
