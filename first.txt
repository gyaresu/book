No network, no joy. Great holiday. Sigh.

Zach was just grinding out the sarcasm from within the safe harbour of his mind. 

On a boat. Headed to Naxos. Sigh. 

This holiday was supposed to be a perk. So far it had been disconnection, loss and longing fed into the machinations of contemporary international transport.

Meat grinder package holiday of doom. Except that it wasn't. Not really. A couple of flights and a few airports with some train action in between had led to Pireus and then from that port back to a hotel while waiting an extra day due to the ferry crew strike.

Sigh.

No pressure. No, really. Zack was supposed to be pressure-less. Doctors orders. Which is an unfortunate expression these days. As if doctors were in any position to give orders any more. Doctors. Another victim of the great knowledge flattening. The distribution and access of the entity now known as the interwebs leaves no edifice uncrumbled.
Pill pushers... now ain't that the truth. Zack's doctor had relieved his pills of duty though. No more oxy, no more adhd glories. Even the percs he'd take with morning espresso had been left behind. For all of Zack's self indulgent egomaniacal mental posturing even he had to admit that there are still some in the world who know a whole lot more than can be presented in any online format. Begrudgingly he respected and trusted Dr. Barnes.
Doc Barnes had been the first glimmer in the darkness after a litany of disinterested prescription monkeys. Th first to verbalise how completly full of himself Zack really was. That was pretty much the first test for Zack. Relinquishing the power of self diagnosis is hard. He respected the doc. Not that he liked what the doc had to say. In fact the doc was downright blunt when it came to his assessment of the viability of Zach's mortal vessel. Zach's mortal vessel was not long for this
world. This was not entirely unexpected news to Zach.

The first meet with the doc had been about three months ago. In that time he'd gone through some detox and some downtime. Just not enough. Hence the islands. The idea being his but being triggered by an end of contract and the payment that should follow. Except that it didn't.



"Only boring people are bored." This thought usually snapped Zack out of his funk. No funk was snapped.
